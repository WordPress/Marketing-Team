# Marketing-Team

### Update May 2024:

Current marketing focus and processes have shifted to a new experimental project called [WordPress Media Corps](https://make.wordpress.org/media-corps/).
Amplification requests and Showcase activities are still running, and you can find out more about them in the following links:

The Marketing Team of WordPress.org promotes WordPress to current and future users and contributors. We create and amplify campaigns to support the growth of the WordPress project.

[Marketing Tasks Board](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/21)

Marketing team discussions and decisions happen on GitHub. Each week we meet in the Marketing team Slack channel to review the open projects and tasks. This helps the team to discuss any issues and share any wins. It also generates greater marketing and cross-team communication and visibility. 

You can also follow WordPress on social media platforms and help amplify our messages: [WordPress Social Media](https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/handbook/social-media-accounts/).
