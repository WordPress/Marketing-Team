# Marketing-Team
The Marketing Team of WordPress.org promotes WordPress to current and future users and contributors. We create and amplify campaigns to support the growth of the WordPress project.

Marketing team discussions and decisions happen on GitHub. Each week we meet in the Marketing team Slack channel to review the open projects and tasks. This helps the team to discuss any issues and share any wins. It also generates greater marketing and cross-team communication and visibility.
